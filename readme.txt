What is this?
This is a simple webapp I wrote which can be put on local web servers.
Anyone on your network can go to the page and add/remove groceries which need to be bought

How to use:
1. Create a local web server if you do not already have one
2. Add index.html to the public_html folder, or wherever your html files are stored
